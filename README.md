# gym-league-script

 this is for the ui https://github.com/Lucasfin000/Orbit-UI-Library

to load it in the game you need this! local lib = loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lucasfin000/Orbit-UI-Library/main/Library", true))()

docs for uplink https://docs.orbituniverse.com/

if the uplink does not work then try rayfield:
https://docs.sirius.menu/rayfield

load string that goes at the top:
local Rayfield = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://sirius.menu/rayfield'))()

Really good dark dex with script viewer:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Babyhamsta/RBLX_Scripts/main/Universal/Lazy_Dex.lua"))()
